# Interactive-Cookbook
The goal is to create an interactive cookbook where plan meals for the future, create shopping lists, and add personal recipes


## Features that need to be done

### Front End

TODO: Need to build out design and look of website/app using either HTML/CSS or React. Make sure that it continues to be interactive with JS of course as well.

### Back End
TODO: likely will be handled with java, but creating objects for each recipe and then having ways to manipulate them as well so that they can be put where you want them to be. You can also have shopping list objects and probably calendar objects as well so that you can hold your recipes in them.

TODO: How are you going to store all of this? I don't know yet but it would be better to maybe have a database instead of storing everything locally?
